# Hi, I'm Carmen 👋

I'm currently pursuing my Computer Engineering degree with a Business minor at the University of Toronto.
I like tech because it has the power to bring people together to solve unique problems in a creative and highly efficient way. 
<br/>
<br/>

### In my free time, I enjoy:
⛷️ Playing badminton and skiing with friends <br/>
🏞️ Taking long walks in the ravine <br/>
💡 Breaking down and visualizing problems using hand-drawn diagrams <br/>
🎶 Listening to loud music after a long day <br/>
🏌️‍♀️🛩️ Learning new skills <br/>
<br/>
