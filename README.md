# Hi, I'm Carmen ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently pursuing my Computer Engineering degree with a Business minor at the University of Toronto.
In my free time, I enjoy: playing badminton and skiing with friends, taking long walks in the ravine, breaking down and 
visualizing problems using hand-drawn diagrams, and listening to loud music after a long day.
